# Chatting With Chess

For Hack The North 2023, we created a program called _Chatting With Chess_.  This program is where a companion, named Chester, can give you some reasonable advice about chess, but some other comments that may or may not be useful. You can also play the incomplete version of the game on here.

This project had much hard work and dedication put into it, and we learned quite a bit about many different technologies, such as:

- Pygame and how to make a game with it
- How to use the ChatGPT Python library in order to create an assistant
- Some third-party libraries that are associated with Pygame
- Using Python in a very extensive way that we both weren't prepared for
- Craeting the game of chess from complete scratch
- Making a UI that's not the greatest, but isn't from the depths of tarturus

We are very proud on what we were able to accomplish in this short span of time and we wish to continue on doing hackathons and doing these sort of projects that push us to be greater.
